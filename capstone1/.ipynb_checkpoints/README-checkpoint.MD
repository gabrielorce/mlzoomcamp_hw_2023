##DATA:

Retrieved from:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/571/hcv+data  

It can also be retrieved from here:
https://github.com/uci-ml-repo/ucimlrepo  

but i chose to download it so i can add it to my source code (in case the dataset is erased in the future, for some reason)

The data set contains laboratory values of blood donors and Hepatitis C patients and demographic values like age.
